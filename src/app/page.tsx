// This file is intentionally blank. 
// The main dashboard content has been moved to /src/app/(app)/page.tsx
// and is part of the (app) route group which handles authenticated layout.
// This root page.tsx can be used for a public landing page if needed in the future,
// or you can set up a redirect to /login or / (which will be handled by (app) group).

// For now, to ensure users are directed correctly, we can add a redirect
// or simply let the (app) group's default page handle the root.
// If this file exists and is empty, Next.js might try to render it.
// It's often better to ensure routing directs to an intended page.

// If you want to redirect from '/' to '/login' if not authenticated,
// or to the dashboard if authenticated, that logic is effectively handled
// by the combination of AuthGuard and the (app) layout.
// An explicit redirect here might be redundant or could conflict.

// For a truly clean setup where '/' is the dashboard after login,
// this file could be removed, and Next.js would use (app)/page.tsx for the '/' path.
// However, to be safe and explicit for now, we can make it a simple redirector
// to the (app) group's root, or just a component that immediately triggers
// the auth flow.

// The simplest approach is to let the (app) group handle the root.
// So, this file can be removed or be a simple component.
// Given the current setup, if a user hits '/', (app)/page.tsx will be matched.

// Let's make this a component that effectively does nothing,
// relying on the route group to take over for '/'.
export default function HomePage() {
  // The actual content for the homepage (dashboard) is in src/app/(app)/page.tsx
  // This component will likely not be rendered directly if the (app) group
  // correctly captures the '/' route.
  // If it were, AuthGuard in (app)/layout.tsx would redirect to /login if not authenticated.
